## Branch Cleanup

```bash
# Delete local branches that are merged
git branch --merged main | grep -v "^\*\|main" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Prune remote-tracking references for deleted remote branches
git fetch -p

# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/user-auth   # Safe delete (only if merged)
git branch -D feature/user-auth   # ⚠ Force delete

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/user-auth
```

## Stash Workflow

```bash
# Save work in progress
git stash push -m "WIP: user authentication"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash
git stash pop

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Drop stash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```
