# Plugin Builder

Build complete knowledge-work plugins through a guided requirements and design process. Plugins turn Claude into a specialist for a specific role, team, or workflow by bundling skills, slash commands, and connectors (MCP servers) into a single distributable package.

Plugins are built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) and are also compatible with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code). Every component is file-based — markdown and JSON, no code, no infrastructure, no build steps.

## How Plugins Work

Every plugin follows the same structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest
├── .mcp.json                    # Tool connections (connectors)
├── CONNECTORS.md                # Documents tool categories and options
├── README.md                    # Usage documentation
├── commands/                    # Slash commands users invoke explicitly
│   └── command-name.md
└── skills/                      # Domain knowledge Claude draws on automatically
    └── skill-name/
        └── SKILL.md
```

**Three component types:**

- **Skills** encode domain expertise, best practices, and step-by-step workflows. Claude draws on them automatically when relevant. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file.
- **Commands** are explicit slash commands users trigger (e.g., `/plugin-name:review-contract`). Each command is a markdown file in `commands/`.
- **Connectors** wire Claude to external tools via MCP servers. Plugin files use `~~category` placeholders (e.g., `~~CRM`, `~~chat`) to stay tool-agnostic. The `.mcp.json` pre-configures specific servers, and `CONNECTORS.md` documents available options.

## Plugin Creation Process

### Phase 1: Discovery — Understand the Plugin's Purpose

Ask the user to describe what the plugin should do. Gather answers to these questions:

1. **Role or function**: "What role or job function is this plugin for? (e.g., sales, legal, finance, customer support, product management, engineering)"
2. **Core capabilities**: "What are the 3-5 key things this plugin should help with?"
3. **Target audience**: "Who will use this — just you, your team, or the community?"
4. **External tools**: "What tools does this role depend on? (e.g., Slack, Jira, Salesforce, Snowflake)"
5. **Example scenarios**: "Give 2-3 examples of how someone would use this plugin day-to-day."

Summarize your understanding and confirm with the user before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Component Inventory — Determine What Goes in the Plugin

Walk through each component type and collaborate with the user to design them.

#### Skills

Skills are domain knowledge Claude draws on automatically when relevant. They encode expertise, best practices, and workflows — the "how your team does things" knowledge.

Ask:
- "What domain expertise should Claude have for this role?"
- "What workflows, best practices, or processes should Claude follow?"
- "Are there any specialized analysis methods, frameworks, or standards?"

For each skill, capture:
- **Name** (kebab-case, 1-64 chars)
- **Description** (what it covers and when Claude should use it)
- **Key content areas** (the domain knowledge, workflows, templates)
- **Customization points** — identify tool-specific references that should use `~~category` placeholders for portability

Good skill examples from existing plugins:

| Plugin | Skill | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| sales | `account-research` | Research methodology, source prioritization, intel synthesis |
| legal | `contract-review` | Playbook-based clause analysis, risk flagging, redline generation |
| data | `sql-queries` | SQL best practices across dialects, common patterns, optimization |
| customer-support | `ticket-triage` | Category taxonomy, priority framework, routing rules |
| marketing | `brand-voice` | Voice documentation, tone adaptation, style guide enforcement |

#### Commands

Commands are explicit slash commands users invoke (e.g., `/plugin-name:command-name`). They define a specific workflow that runs when triggered.

Ask:
- "What explicit actions should users be able to trigger with a slash command?"
- "For each command: What inputs does it need? What does it produce? What's the step-by-step workflow?"

For each command, capture:
- **Name** (becomes `/plugin-name:command-name`)
- **Description** (one-line summary)
- **Workflow** (step-by-step process)
- **Inputs** (what the user provides)
- **Output format** (what gets produced)

Command markdown files should include:
- Trigger description
- Connectors note: `> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).`
- Workflow steps
- Output format
- Example usage

Good command examples:

| Plugin | Command | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| sales | `/call-summary` | Process call notes, extract action items, draft follow-up |
| data | `/analyze` | Answer data questions from quick lookups to full analyses |
| legal | `/review-contract` | Review contract against playbook, flag deviations, generate redlines |
| product-management | `/write-spec` | Generate PRD from problem statement |
| marketing | `/draft-content` | Draft blog posts, social media, emails, landing pages |

#### Connectors (MCP Servers)

Connectors wire Claude to the external tools the role depends on via MCP servers.

Ask:
- "What external tools should this plugin connect to?"
- "For each tool category: What's the primary tool? What are alternatives?"

For each connector, capture:
- **Category** (e.g., CRM, chat, project tracker, data warehouse)
- **Placeholder** (the `~~category` reference used in skill/command files)
- **Primary/included servers** (pre-configured in `.mcp.json`)
- **Alternative options** (other tools in same category)

Connector categories commonly used across plugins:

| Category | Placeholder | Common tools |
|---|---|---|
| Chat | `~~chat` | Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord |
| Email | `~~email` | Microsoft 365, Gmail |
| CRM | `~~CRM` | HubSpot, Salesforce, Close, Pipedrive |
| Project tracker | `~~project tracker` | Jira, Linear, Asana, Monday, ClickUp |
| Knowledge base | `~~knowledge base` | Notion, Confluence, Guru |
| Data warehouse | `~~data warehouse` | Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks |
| Cloud storage | `~~cloud storage` | Box, Egnyte, Dropbox, Microsoft 365 |
| Analytics/BI | `~~analytics` | Amplitude, Tableau, Looker |
| Design | `~~design` | Figma, Canva |
| Office suite | `~~office suite` | Microsoft 365, Google Workspace |

**Important**: Plugin files should be tool-agnostic — use `~~category` placeholders instead of hardcoding specific tool names. This makes the plugin work regardless of which specific tool the user connects.

### Phase 3: Design Review — Refine Before Building

Present a complete design summary showing:

1. **Plugin metadata**: name, description, version, target role
2. **Skills table**: each skill with name and what it covers
3. **Commands table**: each command with name and what it does
4. **Connectors table**: each category with placeholder, included servers, and alternatives
5. **Example workflows**: 2-3 realistic usage scenarios showing skills and commands in action
6. **Directory tree**: the planned file structure

Ask the user:
- "Does this look right? Anything to add, remove, or change?"
- "Are the tool categories correct? Any tools missing?"
- "Do the example workflows cover your most common scenarios?"

Iterate until the user approves the design.

### Phase 4: Implementation — Generate the Plugin

Build the plugin following the standard structure. See [references/plugin-reference.md](references/plugin-reference.md) for the complete schema and conventions.

#### Directory structure

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── .mcp.json
├── CONNECTORS.md
├── README.md
├── commands/
│   ├── command-one.md
│   └── command-two.md
└── skills/
    ├── skill-one/
    │   ├── SKILL.md
    │   └── references/          # Optional, for large reference docs
    └── skill-two/
        └── SKILL.md
```

**Critical rules:**
- Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.claude-plugin/`
- Commands and skills go at the plugin root, NOT inside `.claude-plugin/`
- Use `~~category` placeholders for tool references, not specific tool names
- Every component is markdown or JSON — no code required
- Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines; split large content into `references/`

#### Generate plugin.json

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Brief plugin description"
}
```

The `name` field is the only required field. It becomes the namespace for commands (e.g., `/plugin-name:command`).

#### Generate Skills

Each skill gets a `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` file:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: 'What domain knowledge this covers. Claude uses this automatically when relevant.'
---

# Skill Title

[Domain expertise, workflows, best practices, templates, and frameworks]
```

Skills should:
- Encode "how we do things" knowledge — processes, standards, frameworks
- Use `~~category` for tool references (e.g., "Check ~~project tracker for...")
- Include actionable workflows, not just descriptions
- Provide templates and examples where helpful

#### Generate Commands

Each command gets a `commands/<command-name>.md` file:

```markdown
---
description: One-line summary of what this command does
---

# /command-name

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

[Brief description of purpose]

## Workflow

1. [Step one — gather inputs]
2. [Step two — analyze/process]
3. [Step three — generate output]

## Output Format

[Describe the expected output structure]

## Examples

[Show 1-2 example interactions]
```

#### Generate CONNECTORS.md

```markdown
# Connectors

## How tool references work

Plugin files use `~~category` as a placeholder for whatever tool the user connects in that category. For example, `~~CRM` might mean Salesforce, HubSpot, or any other CRM with an MCP server.

Plugins are **tool-agnostic** — they describe workflows in terms of categories (CRM, chat, email, etc.) rather than specific products. The `.mcp.json` pre-configures specific MCP servers, but any MCP server in that category works.

## Connectors for this plugin

| Category | Placeholder | Included servers | Other options |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Chat | `~~chat` | Slack | Microsoft Teams |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

#### Generate .mcp.json

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp-server-url"
    }
  }
}
```

For servers not yet configured, include a comment-style placeholder or note in CONNECTORS.md that the URL is not yet configured.

#### Generate README.md

Follow the standard pattern used by knowledge-work plugins:

````markdown
# Plugin Name

A [role] plugin primarily designed for [Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), Anthropic's agentic desktop application — though it also works in Claude Code. [Brief description of capabilities].

## Installation

```
claude plugins add marketplace/plugin-name
```

## What It Does

[Bulleted list of key capabilities with brief descriptions]

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/command-one` | ... |
| `/command-two` | ... |

## Skills

```

## Data Sources / MCP Integration

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).

[Describe what tools enhance the plugin and how to connect them]
````

### Phase 5: Customization Points — Make It Adaptable

Review all generated files and ensure tool references use `~~category` placeholders. This pattern allows teams to customize the plugin for their specific tools without rewriting workflows.

For each `~~category` placeholder:
- Verify it appears in CONNECTORS.md with included servers and alternatives
- Ensure skill/command files reference tools generically (e.g., "Check ~~project tracker" not "Check Jira")
- Consider what organization-specific values might need customization

### Phase 6: Validation — Verify the Plugin

Run through this checklist:

- [ ] `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists with valid JSON and a `name` field
- [ ] `name` is kebab-case with no spaces
- [ ] No component directories inside `.claude-plugin/` (only `plugin.json`)
- [ ] Each skill folder contains a `SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` in frontmatter
- [ ] Each command has a `description` in frontmatter
- [ ] All tool references use `~~category` placeholders, not hardcoded tool names
- [ ] `CONNECTORS.md` documents every `~~category` used in the plugin
- [ ] `.mcp.json` pre-configures at least the primary connectors
- [ ] `README.md` includes Installation, What It Does, Commands, Skills, Example Workflows, and Data Sources
- [ ] Skill files are under 500 lines
- [ ] Everything is markdown and JSON — no code, no build steps

Present the checklist results. Fix any issues found.

### Phase 7: Testing & Next Steps

Provide the user with testing and distribution guidance:

**Testing locally (Claude Code):**
```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugin-name
```

**Installing via marketplace (Claude Code):**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add <marketplace-source>
claude plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

**Installing via Cowork:**
Install from [claude.com/plugins](https://claude.com/plugins/).

**Customizing for your team:**
- Edit `.mcp.json` to point at your specific tool stack
- Add company context to skill files (terminology, processes, standards)
- Modify workflows to match how your team actually works
- Replace `~~category` placeholders with your specific tools using the `cowork-plugin-customizer` skill

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Plugin not loading | Validate JSON syntax in plugin.json |
| Commands not appearing | Ensure `commands/` is at root, not inside `.claude-plugin/` |
| Skills not triggering | Check `description` field is detailed enough for Claude to match |
| Connectors not working | Verify `.mcp.json` format and MCP server URLs |
| Namespace wrong | Update `name` field in plugin.json |
| Placeholders still showing | Run customization to replace `~~category` values |
